    review : 'I have been a patient with Estes for eight years. When I started my journey I had no idea what to expect. Kelly and the rest of her team took the time to explain the process and found the right hearing aids that would suite me best. The staff in the New Braunfels and Central Austin offices have been top notch and a pleasure every visit. I will stay with Estes forever and a day if I get it. I highly recommend Estes to those who are either starting the process of using hearing aids or if you currently use them. You won’t be disappointed!'

   review : 'The checkup was pretty quick and easy. Abby was professional in explaining the exam process and the necessary health precautions. Dr. Higginbotham was thorough in her explanation of the results and the variety of actions I could take to improve my hearing. She took time to answer my questions showing me the options for hearing aids and gave several recommendations of what might work well. I was surprised that they have a testing program where I can try out a specific hearing aid to see how it feels and sounds, before committing to getting a pair. I highly recommend Estes Audiology.'

    review : 'I have taken my Mom to see 3 different audiologists here and every single one has been outstanding! We go to the New Braunfels location as that is the closest one to her home. The whole staff is very friendly and welcoming. This latest appointment was to make sure the hearing aid was fitting properly and not causing discomfort. After a change out of the “head”, she is good to go! Highly recommend this professional office and their staff!! ❤'
